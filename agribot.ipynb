HISTORY AND BACKGROUND \\n \\nThe tomato species Lycopersicon esculentum (formerly Solanum lycopersicon belongs to the \\nSolanacea family).  This is an herbaceous, usually sprawling plant of the nightshade family that is \\ntypically cultivated for its edible fruit.  The scientific species name Lycopersicon means \"wolf peach\", \\nand comes from German werewolf myths.  T hese said that deadly nightshade was used to summon \\nwerewolves, so the tomato\\'s similar but much larger fruit was called the \"wolf peach\" when it arrived in \\nEurope from the New World. \\nIt presents itself in different shapes, sizes and colours with different brix or sugar levels.  T omatoes \\nhave very high lycopene content, which has several health benefits.  Some plants have a self-pruning \\ngene responsible for determining the determinate growth habit.  Ripening inhibitor (rin) and non-\\nripening (nr and nor) genes are responsible for determining shelf life, but is not a GMO (genetically \\nmodified organism) trait.  Nowadays long shelf life (LSL) tomatoes are available without these genes. \\n \\nThe tomato was originally taken from Central America.  The first selections where done in Mexico.  It \\nwas brought to Europe by the Spaniards shortly after 1535 and then by the Portuguese to the East \\nbefore 1604.  The Portuguese also took it to their territories around Southern Africa at an early date: \\nexplorers found it there around 1850.  There is evidence that it was also brought to the Cape from the \\nEast: the Afrikaans name for the vegetable “tamatie” probably origin ates from the Malay word \\n“tamatte”.  From a very humble start the tomato grew to one of the most popular vegetable crops in \\nthe world today; bringing Joseph B. Feldt’s prophesy of 1845 to ful/f_ilment: “Like the potato slow in its \\nrise, it is likely to be slow in its fall.”  \\n \\n2. ADAPTABILITY \\n2.1 CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS \\nClimate is one of the most important factors when determining planting times.  The wide variation in \\nclimate in South Africa allows the planting and production of good quality fresh tomatoes in open \\nfields in various parts of the country all year.  Tomatoes are known to be a warm season crop.  It can \\nsurvive certain amounts of cold units, but are intolerant of very low temperatures.  A tomato crop \\nrequires very stable temperature ranges with minimums and maximums not being too wide apart.  \\nTemperature variation might result in poor fruit quality or reduced yields.  The minimum temperature is \\naround 10°C with the maximum being 34°C.  Optimum temperatures are around 26 - 29°C.   \\n \\nTable 1: Required temperature ranges per development stage for optimum tomato production. \\n \\n \\nDevelopmental Stage \\nTemperatures (˚C)  \\nMinimum Optimum Maximum \\nGermination 11 16 - 29 34 \\nVegetative Growth 18 21 - 24 32 \\nFruit set – night 10 14 - 17 20 \\n                 - day  18 19 - 24 30 \\nRed Colouring 10 20 - 24 30 \\nYellow Colouring 10 21 - 32 40 \\nCold Damage  under 6  \\nFrost Damage  under 1  \\nTerminal Damage  -2  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

T omatoes will grow moderately well over a wide range of soil \\ntypes.  However certain criteria have to be satisfied in terms of the soil structure and content to make \\nit commercially viable.  These factors include: \\n□ Nutrient composition \\n□ Compaction \\n□ Effective soil depth \\n□  pH \\n□ Crop rotation \\n□ Herbicide residues \\n□ Water holding capacity  \\n \\nAll these factors can have major influences on the resulting yield.  The soil must permit adequate root \\ngrowth to support the plant and supply water, oxygen and mineral nutrients and must be free of toxic \\nelements.  T he rate of root growth is dependent on the degree of compaction or bulk density of the \\nsoil.  The degree of soil compaction varies with soil type and location.  The rate of aerial and root \\ngrowth of tomato plants increases with the oxygen contents of the soil.  Root density is highest where \\nthere is a high rate of diffusion.  Root development of tomato plants can be extensive if soil water and \\nplant conditions are optimal.  They can be as deep as 1.5 m and as wide as plant spacing will allow.  \\nEarly root development should be encouraged, because nearly all root growth occurs before fruit set.  \\nThe importance of organic matter cannot be over emphasized.  Organic matter in the form of decayed \\nleaves, compost, sawdust or animal manure is a source of plant nutrients and acts as a soil \\nconditioner.  It increases the capacity of the soil to retain water and nutrients.  It also promotes root \\ngrowth and the infiltration of water and air into the soil. \\n \\n \\n2.3 PRODUCT TYPES \\nUntil about a decade ago the tomato range consisted mostly of fresh market and processor types \\nonly.  T oday there are numerous types of tomatoes marketed and many shops even like to sell only \\ntheir own brand.

CULTIVATION PRACTICES \\n3.1 SOIL PREPARATION \\nSoil preparation improves the potential for profitable production of tomatoes.  Any primary soil \\npreparation must be aimed at creating growing conditions for tomato plants to develop the optimal \\nroot system in a specific soil profile.  Although the root structure of a tomato plant can penetrate \\nvarious soil types up to depths of 2 meters, the highest percentage roots will be found in the top \\n600mm of the soil.  The advantages of soil preparation are: \\n \\nNo restrictions on root development. \\nLess chance of compaction. \\nMore oxygen in the soil creating better root development. \\nHigher yield. \\nReduction in production costs. \\nMore vegetative growth. \\nMore tolerance to drought and stress. \\nLess root disease prevalence. \\nHorizontal and vertical compaction layers broken. \\nBetter water retention. \\nIncreased uptake of moisture and nutrients. \\n \\nThe choice of preparation systems should be determined by the plant requirements and the soil type.  \\nThereafter, economic factors should be considered.  No standard system can be recommended on all \\nsoil types.  T he choice of preparation method should be made based on the clay content of the soil.  \\nFor example on sandy soils the focus should be to reduce compaction and erosion, where on heavier \\nsoils it will be to reduce crust formation.  Soil preparation should be done to depths varying between \\n200 – 400mm.  Ridging is highly recommended, and should be done according to the land contours.  \\nThe main advantage of ridging a tomato crop is to keep excess water away from the plant, improved \\noxygenation of the root zone, increased soil depth in the growing bed, to promote root development. \\n \\n3.2 PLANTING PERIODS \\nA number of factors should be taken into consideration when determining planting times.  These \\nfactors are: \\n \\nThe effect of temperature on plant growth, flowering and fruit set \\nTomatoes grow and produce the best when the mean temperatures are between 20 and 24˚C.  This \\nis however a very general statement, as the effect of high temperature in the day can be offset by a \\nlower night temperature or in some cases by lower light intensity.  The plant has the ability to grow \\nwell at temperatures well above 30˚C; but these temperatures have a negative eﬀ ect on fruit set.  The \\ncritical factor with regard to fruit set is the night temperature, which should be from 15-20˚C for the \\noptimum set.  When the average daily temperature is above 32˚C and the night temperature is above \\n21˚C fruit set is poor. Fruit set generally fails below 13˚C.  \\n \\nThe earliest period for seedling establishment would be when the soil and air temperatures at least \\nmeet the minimum requirements for plant growth.  \\nThe latest seedling establishment period would be after allowance has been made for the growth \\nand harvest periods to be completed before adverse conditions sets in. \\n \\nDue to the effect of certain factors being prevalent at specific locations, within each of these areas the \\nplanting times may be earlier or later than the times given below. \\n \\nEstablishment periods for the main production areas of South Africa will then be: \\n1. Lowveld (frost free areas) – Feb to May \\n2. Middleveld (moderate areas) – Sept to Dec \\n3. Highveld (cold areas) – Oct to Nov \\n4.

This is done in \\norder to utilise its full potential on colour and taste.  South Africa is one of only a few countries in the \\nworld that pick their fruit at mature green to colour break stage.  This is due to consumers not being \\naware that varieties have changed and can now easily be picked at full ripe stage.  They still have the \\nperception that a red ripe tomato is over mature.

Protection against the natural elements and pests is  obtained by the use of a transparent \\nmaterial that allows sunlight to enter the  structure and  then converting  the trapped solar energy  to \\nheat, thus providing increased temperatures for continued production. In advanced structures, \\nhumidity and even light can be controlled to ensure maximum crop yields. \\n3.3 SEEDLING PRODUCTION \\nSeedling establishment: \\nModel 128 or 200 seedling trays are the most popular. \\nAlthough more expensive, larger seedling trays lead to better and more root development. \\nSeedlings take 4 – 6 weeks in summer to reach transplant maturity. \\nSeedlings take about 8 weeks in winter to transplant maturity.  \\nDeep sowing: More advantageous in warmer conditions.       \\nSeed takes longer to surface due to cooler temperatures and longer growing distances.  \\nShallow sowing:  More advantageous in cooler conditions. \\nSeed surface quicker due to warmer temperatures and short growing distances.  Efficient levels of \\nmoisture are necessary.  \\nThe effect of soil- or growth media temperature on seed germination \\nTable 2 gives a good indication of the best temperature ranges for seed germination.

This is mainly done in \\ngreenhouses and farmers producing open land processing types for paste.  The single most important \\nfactor when making a dec ision around plant p opulation is the type of chemical spraying system- or \\nmethod that the grower is going to use for the duration of the crop.

With varieties that have a determinate habit the yield per \\nplant will stay relatively constant to different plant populations, but too high populations will make a \\ndifference.  A recent intensive trial study was done at Starke Ayres and the following observations \\nwere made: Determinate varieties showed no significant differences in fruit size between the different \\nplanting densities.  Indeterminate varieties definitely showed an increase in fruit size but only to a \\ncertain level.  Looking at marketable yields as well as the yields of large fruit, it was clear that the \\ntrend on the determinate types was towards yielding the best at the highest plant population.   T he \\nindeterminate types had no significant effect.  Farming in general requires producing the highest yield \\nof saleable product.  The best yield of saleable product was generally achieved at the higher plant \\npopulations. \\n \\nThese recommendations are followed for Starke Ayres material:  \\nOpen land: 12 – 18 000 plants /ha. \\nOpen land untrellised: 15 000 plants /ha \\nUnder protection: 20 – 28 000 plants/ha. \\nOpen land processing: 28-35 000 plants/ha \\n \\nTable 3: Plant population guide \\nBetween Rows (cm) \\n \\nBetween plants (cm) \\n20 25 30 35 40 50 \\n150 33 000 26 400 22 000 19 000 16 500 13 200 \\n175 28 500 22 800 19 000 16 300 14 285 11 400 \\n200 25 000 20 000 16 700 14 300 12 400 10 000 \\n225 22 000 17 600 14 600 12 700 11 000 8 800 \\n250 20 000 16 000 13 300 11 400 10 000 8 000 \\n \\nThe plant population table above can be used as a quick guideline. For example: if the distance \\nbetween rows is 2 meters with the distance between plants 30 cm, one will have a plant population of \\n16 700 plants per ha.  \\n \\nProduction under protection  \\nThe planting density should be around 3-4 plants/m². This is mainly done where medium to smaller \\nfruit is needed for speciality and high quality markets. Plants are trained to single, double or three \\nstems on supporting strings and stopped at a height of 2 meters or more.    \\n \\n \\n \\n3.4.1 TRANSPLANTING SEEDLINGS \\nThe production of good quality, healthy seedlings require the correct choice of both variety and \\nseedling grower.  The correct soil preparation, analyses and fertilizer application prior to planting also \\nneeds to be done.  Before seedlings are collected from the nursery, land preparation should be \\ncompleted and irrigation systems should be in place.  At this point some growers already install the \\ntrellising system such as poles and first wires.  Seedlings must be hardened off before leaving the \\nnursery.  This is done by making sure that excessive nitrogen and irrigation is kept to a minimum.  \\nTwo to five days before collecting the seedlings, they must be taken out of the nursery and placed in a \\nposition where more sunlight is prevalent.  \\n \\nIt is highly recommended to always establish seedlings in wet soil.  Always make sure that the holes \\non the ridges where seedlings are about to be transplanted are exactly the same size as the seedling \\nplugs.  This will prevent issues such as J-rooting where seedling plugs are forced into the soil and \\nroots are bent over resulting in seedling uniformity issues and yield losses.  A lthough it is not \\nrecommended to establish these plants, it happens from time to time that a grower receives over \\nmature or taller plants than normal.  In this instance it is recommended to sterilize the stem with a ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Under- or over irrigation can \\nhave a devastating effect on the outcome of the crop.  It is therefore very important to apply water at \\noptimal times.  \\n \\nToo little water might lead to: \\n□ Sub-optimum yields. \\n□ Decrease in the photosynthetic rate. \\n□ Plants developing stunted growth. \\n□ No production of flowers. \\n□ Low percentage fruit set. \\n□ Slow fruit development. \\n□ Small fruit sizes. \\n□ Poor quality. \\n□ Flower abortion. \\n \\nToo much water might lead to: \\n□ Not enough oxygen in the soil. \\n□ Plants becoming wilted. \\n□ Root diseases becoming prevalent. \\n□ No plant development. \\n \\nWhen scheduling irrigation, the size of the root system at the time of irrigation needs to be taken into \\naccount.  In general, the root system can be compared to the aerial growth of the plant.  The roots \\nspread into the soil at a similar rate to which the aerial growth develops.  Most tomato roots occur in \\nthe top 500 – 600 mm of soil level, even at maturity.  For this reason irrigation should be monitored at \\nthis level with irrometers.  Deep, thorough irrigations are preferable to light and regular watering \\nintervals.  Drip or flood irrigation is preferable to overhead irrigation, due to susceptibility to foliar \\ndiseases.  T he amounts of water used will vary depending on the climatic conditions.  During the \\ncooler months tomatoes require about 25mm per week and this might increase to 50mm under very \\nhot, windy and dry conditions.  For irrigation purposes, the growth of tomatoes can be divided into four \\ngrowth stages.  \\n \\nStage 1: Establishment \\n Can last up to 4 weeks.

Wire or rope can be used and should be done at first flowering \\nstage or around one month after transplant.  Although more expensive, wires last longer and don’t \\nhave the ability to gather diseases.  Rope could be infected with bacterial spores and should be \\nsterilized after use.  Poles should be planted around 40 – 50 cm into the soil and not more than 3 \\nmeters apart.  It is essential that the end or corner poles are supported.  Poles should be able to carry \\nthe plant and its fruit, and withstand side winds.  When rows are 1.5 meters apart and the crop is \\nplanted in a 1 hectare square block, one would need 2200 poles and around 17 – 20 000 meters of \\nwires if 4 sets or 8 lines of wire are used.  \\n \\nA tomato plant has the ability to grow up to 15cm per week and constant trellising should be done.  \\nThe plant will make side shoots that grow to the sides of the main plant.  T hese shoots should be \\nneatly tucked in between the wires and not damaged.  This should at least be done on a weekly \\nbasis.  T rellising under protection could be done in two ways.  O ne way would be to do it the same \\nway as the conventional open field method, or what growers refer to as the Spanish method.  This is \\ndone by trellising a steel wire at 2 – 2.5 meters above the row.  Rope or twine is then hung down from \\nthis wire for the plant to be able to be guided up against the rope.  As the plant matures, the rope \\nwould then be shortened or rolled up at the top.
